    "A restaurant is a business which prepares and serves food and drink to customers. It is no surprise to learn that owning a restaurant comes with its fair share of responsibilities that require you to be on your feet. To be successful in the long run, a restaurant needs an accessible location, a theme or style that appeals to a broad range of customers, and a solid menu. Restaurants must stand out from the crowd and finalizing a space within the budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is evident that to survive in such competitive market it is very important to startegically plan. Often there’s an issue of time constraint that keeps a restaurant owner preoccupied with intricacies. Whether it is sourcing the right ingredients, obtaining too many licences, finalizing a space within your budget to interviewing the right staff — restaurateurs have to consider everything beginning from a pin to piano before taking the right foot forward.\n",

    "First move is very important, thereby choice of location is very important. So, HSB India (P) Ltd., plan to choose the correct location to start its first restaurant in Toronto, Canada. "
